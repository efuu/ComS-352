I create three file, uthread.c and uthread.h will all the function, and test.c with main() and test codes. You can add or modify my test.c file if you want.
If you want to compile my code, just "make" it, and my makefile will compile it automatically.
After finishing it, "make clean" will clean all the object files.
Thank you!
